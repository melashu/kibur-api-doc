 }
}
```
> Note: `Except` `pin_to_top` all attributes are `required`.

The `user_id` in a menu indicates the person responsible for preparing the registered menu. When a new order for this menu is placed, a notification about the order will be sent directly to the user associated with the menu.

In simpler terms, the user associated with the `user_id` will be alerted and tasked with fulfilling the order when a new order for their menu is created.

The `category_id` parameter specifies the category to which a particular menu belongs. Whenever a new menu is added, the `number_of_menus` property of the corresponding category is incremented.

If you successfully created a menu the API will return 

```json
{
    "id": 27,
    "name": "Tegabino",
    "price": 120.0,
    "pin_to_top": true,
    "created_by": "Munit Amare",
    "category": {
        "id": 2,
